### Day 1   
During lecture we displayed images in 3D using an image stack and an array in python. We then displayed a side of the image stack in 3D.

### Day 2

Discussed the research pressentation, viewed the fixed 3D demo for highlighting images. Discussed speed and usage with a 3D stack. Slides arent all aligned so will cause issue with projects.
